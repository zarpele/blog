Custom module to import a Wordpress CSV generated by [WP CSV](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-csv/) plugin in Drupal 9.

Using:

    - migrate_source_csv

Run
------------
Run post migration:
```bash
drush mim zarpele_migrate_post --update
```
Run comment migration:
```bash
drush mim zarpele_migrate_comment --update
```

Data Source
------------

To generate the .csv file, I used [WP CSV](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-csv/) Wordpress plugin. The plugin seems pretty outdated, but it's good enough for my requirements.

As you can see, the migration yml is pointing to a file in my `/sites/default/files` folder, this is a private directory. I left a sample inside this module on data folder, so you can compare the columns and run the migration locally.
